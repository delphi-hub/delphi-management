## What is the Delphi Management Console?

It is a web application to allow administrators to control the crawling process.

## How does it work?

It takes commands from authenticated administrators over the web interface and issues the appropriate steps in the crawler.

## How can I use it?

For any deployed instance you need an administrator account to interact with the application.
You can start your own instance by executing
```
sbt run
```
