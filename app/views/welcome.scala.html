        <h1>What is Delphi?</h1>

        <p>
            Delphi is a platform to retrieve meta-information on JVM-bytecode based projects.
        </p>


        <h2>What can Delphi do for you?</h2>

        <p>
            You can either query a complete set of information for a specific project or you can retrieve a list of
            matching projects based on specific metrics.
        </p>

        <h2>What is this page used for?</h2>

        <p>
            Once implemented, this page will give you access to the management interface of Delphi. You will be able
            to control the Delphi-Crawlers, configure the Elasticsearch database and administrate your instances of
            Delphi. For now, this page is a placeholder for the future implementation.
        </p>
